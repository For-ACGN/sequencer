# sequencer
A simple program to rename and sort files in a folder.

## Usage
Move the program to the folder you need to sort, then run the program.

## Purpose
Some file managers do not use natural sorting when processing file sorting, which will cause 10.png to be sorted before 2.png. This program can easily solve this problem.
